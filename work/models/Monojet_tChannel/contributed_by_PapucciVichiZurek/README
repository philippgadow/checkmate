Hi Antonio,

Here is the MadGraph model for SM+Squarks+DM.
In this model the Dark matter is a Dirac fermion with PDG number 18.
Also, we had two versions:

_ 8 squarks (1st two generations, left+right)
_ 2 squarks (down and strange right)


Concerning the generator configurations:

_We always set the Squarks degenerate;
_We set the width of the squarks manually to the minimal (i.e. the one generated by the decay to quarks and DM with the value of the coupling used in the generation) or to other  benchmark values.
_the only substantial thing we tuned was the value of  xqcut=max(40., Squark_mass /4) for the matching process.

Let me know if you need additional details. Most of them are in the paper anyway.
Best,

Alessandro
